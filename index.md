## Overview

Manoa Clubs Finder is a web application that provides a centralized directory for UH Manoa student clubs. UH Manoa students can login to browse a well organized directory of all current student clubs, with brief descriptions, meeting times and locations, URLs to their websites (if any), contact information for officers, and a few select photos.

Manoa Clubs Finder has three user roles, all of whom login with their UH ID. Regular users browse the directory. Club Admins have the ability to edit the data associated with their club. Super Admins make sure site content is appropriate and grant “club admin” privileges to selected users.

Users can sort through all the clubs using catagories or keywords and can specify interest areas, and be notified when a new club is created matching that interest area (or an existing club adds that interest area).

This web application uses information from [Student Life and Development at UH Manoa](http://www.manoa.hawaii.edu/studentlife/studentorg/rio.php) to get all the Registered Independent Organizations at UH Manoa.
